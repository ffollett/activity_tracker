This project is an attempt to record activity on the computer and catalog it for analysis. I'm also using this project to learn to interface with sqlite3 and practice streamlit.  

Switching tasks frequently makes the task of recording how much time I've dedicated to various tasks/projects very burdensome.  

I prefer not to stick to a strictly proscriptive schedule if I don't have to, but I still want to be able to look back and see what I've spent my time on, to compare what I have to show for it.
